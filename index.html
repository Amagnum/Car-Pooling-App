    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Since inappropriate planning of the cities, there has been a big problem of traffic in most cities
        of India. People spend much of their time in traffic every day. In Addition to this many vehicles
        in traf ic makes rapid oil consumption, there has been an uprising problem of air pollution. Oil
        supplies are very limited all over the world and oil prices are extremely expensive in our
        country. Therefore, most of the people have to take buses and since the number of public
        transportation vehicles are not suf icient, they travel under uncomfortable conditions.
        <br><br>There are some attempts to solve these problems, however, they focus only on intercity transportation.
        We
        came up with an ef ective solution as www.uniteonwheels.com .Our project will be used for both
        intercity and urban transportations all over India. As a result, our system will be designed to
        solve these problems and deficiencies of other systems .
    </p>
    <h1>Scope</h1>
    <p>The “Car Pooling for IITI” is a GPS-based mobile application which helps people to find the
        closest vehicle based on the user’s current position and other specifications like time of
        departure, price, contact information of passengers travelling and number of seats available. This
        information will act as the basis for the search results displayed to the user. The application
        should be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar services.
        Furthermore, the software needs both Internet and GPS connection to fetch and display results.
        All system information is maintained in a database, which is located on firebase( an online db
        service). The application uses the mobile phone’s GPS navigator. By using the GPS-Navigator,
        users can view available vehicles on a map and can navigate towards them. The application also
        has the capability of representing both summary and detailed information about the available
        vehicles which will take the passenger to the required destination .
        <br><br>This application will bring about a big revolution in sharing vehicles thus reducing pollution and
        traffic in cities. This will be operated from both the passenger intended to travel and the
        passenger already travelling in a vehicle and willing to share their ride.

    </p>
    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>#Sign Up: Users need to sign up to use the app. The users should have a username and
            password. After filling their name, surname, email, age, designation, phone and gender
            information, they register into the system.
        </li><br>
        <li> #Sign In: If a user is signed up, s/he can sign in the system by filling username and password
            boxes.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            #Sign Out: A user may need to sign out of the system. He/She can do it by clicking the sign out
            button which is placed on every page.
        </li><br>
        <li>#Accepting passengers preferences: This functionality allows passengers to enter their
            departure point, arrival point, mode of transport(car,autos,cabs,busses), date and time of
            departure.There will be certain tolerance limit set by the user itself(for this we will have to set
            lower tolerance limit(before preferred time) and upper tolerance limit(after preferred time) for
            extracting recommendations) . User also can select the clusters which he/she wants to join i.e., if
            he/she wants to join a favourite
        </li><br>
        <li>#Personalised suggestions: Our CarPooling Application analyses the database frequently and
            gives personalised suggestions regarding best departing time(based on time tolerances)(this is
            dif erent from preferred time as it may happen that a big cluster may begin their journey at some
            time just before or after the preferred time, so our app may request us to depart at the nearest
            time possible to the preferred time) , travelling time, mode of transport(car,autos,cabs,busses)
            and nearest pickup locations and all other locations of pickup(there will be a certain criterion
            (distance)for suggesting a place as the best point for boarding the vehicle which is certainly
            walkable from the current position of the user)(this is dif erent from our point of departure as
            sometimes, it may happen that a big cluster may depart from a point near the preferred pickup
            point , so our app may suggest them to depart from the changed point) (this functionality also
            encompasses route to that point)so that number of clusters is minimised at any point of time,
            which is beneficial to all the users, as per head cost is significantly reduced.
        </li><br>
        <li>#Adding clusters to the database: Our application also needs user’s amicable co-ordination. If
            users are ready to accompany some people then, this may also become a potential cluster and
            adding this to the database will improve the reachability of the app. So, we enable users of the
            app with the best possible UI to add their current location, their departure time, departure point,
            arrival point. This is also integrated with personal chat with the passengers of the cluster for
            knowing the conditions of the traf ic and also the feasibility of their inclusion in their cluster i.e,
            if there exists heavy traf ic in the route planned before then, by personal chat existing passengers
            may request him/her to choose another cluster over them or begin a new cluster.
        </li><br>
        <li>#Send Message: The users can communicate with each other by sending messages.
        </li><br>
        <li>#Reply To A Message: After receiving a message, the user can read the message and reply to it.
        </li><br>
        <li># Block User: When a user receives a disturbing message, s/he can block the user who send that
            message.
        </li><br>
        <li>#See cluster’s route: This functionality enables the user to see a particular cluster’s current
            route and this is preceded by a set of all available clusters ready to accommodate additional
            passengers.
        </li><br>
        <li>#Disable additional inclusions: This functionality disables the cluster to allow additional
            passengers. Passengers can do this if they feel that they can’t accommodate additional
            passengers and it stops covering their details.
        </li><br>
        <li>#Feedback from the customers: This functionality enables the customer to give their
            feedback/suggestions regarding the service provided by the app and it lets the developers know
            what functionalities are to be added from time to time on a regular basis . Users rate the
            application by stars ranging from 1 to 5 inclusive of floating numbers ending with .5 .
        </li><br>
    </ul>
    <h1>User Characteristics</h1>
    <p>Users of this application belong to the community of IIT INDORE in the preliminary stage of the
        app. Users need to enter the details and know the details at any point of time , mentioned in the
        section of 2.2.They need to go to the city or some other tourist spots present in the vicinity of IIT
        INDORE . For that, they need to know where and when maximum number of passengers are
        using a particular automobile and list of groups of people who are ready to accommodate more
        people. People needing to use the pooling service will only use the application. They may also be
        ready to leave from the place
